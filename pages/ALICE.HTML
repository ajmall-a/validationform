        Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' is the best known work of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832 - 1898) - better known by his pen name, 'Lewis Carroll'. Telling the tale of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by surreal and anthropomorphic creatures, the book was a huge commercial success on its initial publication in 1865. The book plays at the heart of logical problems and literary nonsense - giving the narrative lasting popularity with adults and children alike. The story is accompanied by a series of dazzling, full colour, Arthur Rackham illustrations (1867 - 1939). One of the most celebrated painters of the British Golden Age of Illustration (which encompassed the years from 1850 until the start of the First World War), Rackham's artistry is quite simply, unparalleled. Throughout his career, he developed a unique style, combining haunting humour with dream-like romance. In this text, he portrays a wonderland which could disturb as often as it enchanted; a dark place depicted in dark hues of brown, greens and greys - giving a beautiful and ethereal nature to Alice's imaginary realm. Presented alongside the text, his illustrations further refine and elucidate Carroll's masterful storytelling.
